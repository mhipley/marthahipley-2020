##### who is your ideal client?

there are a lot of website builder tools on the internet. for some kinds of projects they are great. if a website builder or pre-made template feels right for you, you don’t need me! 



if you want custom control over your aesthetic presentation and content online, hit me up! if you’d like control over how your content is hosted and want to rely on open source tools, I can help! if you want to make your web project unique with custom interactive or immersive features, please be in touch! if you want to sell things online but feel like your brand needs a next-level experience, I can make it happen! if you want to make something weird on the internet and have a budget, let’s talk!



if you don’t know what you need, [schedule a free consultation](https://calendly.com/hipley/30min)!



##### why no apps?

apps are complicated, expensive, unfun, and high drama. the world doesn’t need more apps! I also no longer consult re: startup/investment world strategy or product planning. if you need a better landing page for your product, I'm available. if you need help designing what that product is, I'm not.



##### what is a “community” vs. “small business” vs. a “scaled business” project?

for my purposes, a small business is < 5 salaried employees and **no** investment funding. if you identify as a startup and have pre-seed money or are in an incubator, you are under the scaled rate. if you are a small business who is subcontracting me for a larger business, I will quote the scaled rate.



if you are a small business or organization whose members identify as femme, queer, or BIPOC or if you are reaching out as an individual for any kind of personal project, community pricing is for you.



##### are you flexible on your prices?

this is as low as I can go, and these should be considered a minimum rate for simple projects, not a negotiable middle range. I truly only want to work on cool stuff with cool people, but I also have to pay bills and value my time. I keep my prices as low as possible in order to work with interesting people on projects I can care about. these rates are based on my needs and expectations for the first 6 months of 2021, and I will be reevaluating and updating these documents in April.



I do not negotiate for equity, but I am open to barter when it makes sense with my schedule and needs. if you want to pay in crypto, idk, we can talk about it. if you are not based in the US, we can figure it out.



I currently do not have time for pro-bono projects or unpaid collaborations. I hope to have more pro-bono availability later in 2021 and will update this site accordingly.



##### why are your prices more (or less!) expensive than the last time we talked?

if you are an existing paying client, don’t worry! your pricing has not changed (unless you're now paying less!). these are the prices that make sense for my cost of living and availability for 2021, and will not change until I reevaluate in April 2021.



##### I already have a website design ready, why is the price difference only $200 less for development only?

in my experience, I end up doing quite a bit of ad hoc visual design and UX work when working with another designer. there’s a lot of stuff about the realities of frontend development and accessibility for web that comes up when I begin to work with someone on their designs, so you are still paying for my design expertise no matter what. think of it more as: “buy the development and get the design services as a bonus!” and not: “do my own design and save a measly $200.”



##### do you subcontract?

sometimes! sometimes I will subcontract work on an hourly basis (ex., content management) or on a project basis (ex., hiring an illustrator with a particular style to do spot illustrations). when I subcontract, I will present a quote to you after negotiating with the subcontractor. I will never bill you for subcontracted work without a clear agreement from you in advance.



##### how do you invoice?

I send invoices for hourly billing on the last day of the month, and milestone invoices for project billing. all projects require a 50% deposit, with the rest due 30 days from the completion of all deliverables. hourly invoices are also due within 15 days. if you are under the community rate umbrella, I am happy to negotiate a payment plan to meet your needs. I send invoices via a service that allows you to pay directly via Stripe with any debit or credit card.



any 3rd party commercial licenses (for example, if you want to use an Adobe stock photo, or need to host videos for your site with a premium Vimeo account), are either purchased directly by you or prepaid by you before use. I do not pay up front for any licenses.



I sometimes use open source tools made by small teams and will make a donation from my own fee to those teams on completion of a project. 



##### here’s this art I like, can you copy this?

taking inspiration is great, but if you just want me to copy someone’s style (or steal a licensed image, typeface, etc.), we shouldn’t work together. if you want me to contract an artist you like to contribute to a project, I’m happy to manage that.



##### do you do branding?

not really! a web design & development package includes conversations about colors, typography, language choice, and aesthetics, but I do not do logo design or other branding work.



##### what type of tools do you use?

it depends! I do a lot of Wordpress development because it is a well-supported tool and meets most people’s needs in a cost-effective way. I also have a lot of experience with Shopify design and development. I have experience in maintaining and repairing Squarespace and Wix sites. a special microsite or a tech-savvy client may not need a full-featured CMS at all or may need an entirely custom frontend built using other frameworks (this site is built with Jekyll, for example). I have worked on Drupal and Joomla sites, but I find those to be less common these days.



[schedule a free consultation](https://calendly.com/hipley/30min) to find out what will work for your needs.



##### why should I pay you to host my site?

you don’t have to! there are cheaper options out there, and I’m happy to work with whatever you choose. my pricing is lower than using a premium hosting service like Squarespace, but certainly more expensive than many budget hosts. if I host your site, the advantages are:



- never having to deal with your host’s customer service line directly or personally deal with outages
- high quality services for less than the cost of other premium hosts
- feeling slightly less bad about climate change because I use a carbon-offset dedicated server



If I don’t host your site, I am still more than happy to help with outages and customer service issues, but I will charge my hourly rate accordingly. 1 year of hosting with me costs the same as 1 call from me to GoDaddy to figure out why your site is down.



in the long term, I plan to invest in sustainable, independent, green infrastructure for all of my projects, and hosting with me is a way to support that process.



##### what is off limits?

I reserve the right to reject any projects that don’t vibe with my personal values. I don’t want unchill or abusive people or projects in my portfolio. 



I also reserve the right to terminate any contract if I find out any association with harassment, hate speech, or abuse. I both care about protecting my own reputation and about protecting the needs and expectations of my other clients.



##### why are you explaining all of this?

after years of pricing my work privately, on a per-client basis, I wanted to explore a set sheet of rates and expectations that I can roll out as a 6-month experiment in setting boundaries around my labor and needs. it also means that [your free consultation](https://calendly.com/hipley/30min) can be about your exciting ideas and not about covering the nitty gritty.
