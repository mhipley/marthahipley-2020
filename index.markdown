### bio

I’m an experienced designer and technologist with a professional background that ranges from pre-seed startups to 100+ year-old organizations. I specialize in UX-centered product design, management, and development, and I have hands-on experience with all steps of the product cycle. I also write, give talks, and teach on the intersection of design and technology, and I have exhibited conceptual projects at Haus de Elektronischen Künste in Basel, the Museum of Human Achievement in Austin, Gray Area in San Francisco, and Carnegie Mellon's Art&&Code conference in Pittsburgh.
