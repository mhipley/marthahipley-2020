Martha did a great job on a website I created for my small independent record label. Martha was great at soliciting feedback on the aesthetic I was looking for and incorporated those elements into the website design as if I had done it myself. Some of the features I love the best about the site came from ideas that I didn't initially put on the table but that Martha had a way of pulling out of me. Martha's experience as an illustrator was crucial to the final product. I wanted a website that was functional but not overly professional. Martha provided me with illustrations for the site and the album cover for our first release that really made my audience take notice. I would definitely hire Martha again!
